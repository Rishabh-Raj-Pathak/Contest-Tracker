Contest Tracker

- Description
    - Build a contest tracker that fetches all the upcoming contests from Codeforces, CodeChef, and Leetcode.
    - Show the date of each contest and time remaining before starting.
    - Also show the past contests in the last 2 weeks.
    - also have another section to show calendar view.
    - Have a filter to allow the users to select contests from only 1 or more platforms. Eg: Only from Codeforces, or from Codeforces + Leetcode.
    - Allow the users to bookmark a contest.
    - Have a way to populate the link to the contest solution from Youtube (TLE Eliminators (1st priority) or any other relevent source) of a past contest. If you want to handle this manually, you can make a separate URL which contains a form where you can select the contest and attach the corresponding link from our channel.
    - Bonus: Automatically fetch the links from Youtube and add them once the solution is uploaded without requiring a person to do it manually.
    - Bonus: Add an option for people to sign up for contest reminders for a platform. Allow them to choose b/w email and sms reminders. Also allow them to choose when to get the reminder. Eg: 1 hour or 30 minutes before the contest.
